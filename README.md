# Airport Challenge
- As part of end of week 1 challenge, I designed a software which controls the flow of planes at an airport

## My Approach
- Created a diagram of the objects and interactions between each of them [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ldPBBp0=/)
- Created a separate class for each object
- Tried writing methods according to the Single Responsibility Principle
- Wrote unit tests including stub for controlling weathers and isolating other variables
- Wrote a feature test with scenarios involving multiple airports and planes

## Passing criteria
- All tests passing: YES - 17 examples all passing including a feature test
- High test coverage: 100% including a feature test
- Code quality: tried to code with SRP
- 

## Learning Takeaways
- Completed testing driving the creation of a set of classes to satisfy user stories
- Wrote a feature test for the first time on rspec
- Gained more familiarity with using rspec such as using stub and raising error
- No offenses on Rubocop
